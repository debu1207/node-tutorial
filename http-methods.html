    <h2>HTTP request methods</h2>
    <p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.</p>

    <p>Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes refereed to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
          <th>GET</th>
          <td>The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>HEAD</th>
          <td>The HEAD method asks for a reponse identical to a GET request, but without the response body.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>POST</th>
          <td>The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>PUT</th>
            <td>The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>DELETE</th>
            <td>The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>CONNECT</th>
            <td>The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.</td>
        </tr>
        
      </table>
